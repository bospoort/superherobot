# ContentModerationBot

## Introduction
This bot uses two Cognitive Services APIs: face recognition and content moderation. You can create a list of faces of known people. By default, there is a list of tech company execs. The bot allows you to submit a picture. Before comparing the picture to the entries of known people on the list, it uses the Content Moderation APIs for flagging inappropriate content. You can use either the simple content moderation APIs to analyze individual pictures or the review API with the Review UI. This Review Studio allows human beings to manually evaluate pictures and flag appropriately. When a human resource has the picture reviewed, Content Moderator Review invokes your callback to notify you of the results. 

## Setting it up
You will need to create a .env file with the following keys. 

``` JSON
cm_id   = {Id obtained from credentials page in https://contentmoderator.cognitive.microsoft.com/}
cm_key  = {Key obtained from credentials page in https://contentmoderator.cognitive.microsoft.com/}
ocp_key = {Key obtained from Cognitive services resource in portal.azure.com}

storageAccountName  = {Azure storage account}
storageAccountKey   = {Azure storage key}

faceAPIkey  = {faceapikey. Key obtained from Cognitive services resource in portal.azure.com}

MICROSOFT_APP_ID        = {bot app id from dev.botframework.com}
MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD  = {bot password from dev.botframework.com}

#moderation or review
moderationMode=review
```

First you'll need actual Content Moderation keys: 
1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) 
2. Click on the '+' sign to create a new resource
3. Search for 'Cognitive Services' and create the resource
4. In the following API type drop down, select 'Content Moderator'
5. Create appropriate resource groups and and other settings for this account.
6. Go to keys and copy one of the values into ocp_key in .env above  

You will also need a Face API key. 
1. Go through the same steps as above, but select Face API under step 4.  
6. Go to keys and copy one of the values into faceAPIkey in .env above.   

Finally, you need to create a storage account. This is used to store the images that your users submit to the bot. 
1. Click on the '+' sign to create a new resource
3. Search for 'Storage Account', select 'Microsoft Storage' and click create 
4. Give it a name, and other settings (default is fine)
5. Create appropriate resource groups and and other settings for this account.
6. Copy the Storage account name and one of the keys into storageAccountName and storageAccountKey

## Getting the callback
Content Moderator needs a callback for pictures when you post them for a job and when someone has reviewed them in the Review UI. Since it might be hard to find your IP behind a firewall, you can set up the end point with ngrok: 
```
ngrok http <port>.
```
where <port> is the port you specify in app.js line 15. I use an environment variable (process.env.WEBSITE_HOSTNAME) that Azure populates for my app service once deployed. For testing in the Bot emulator I set this variable in my launch.json file. 

## Creating your own list
The project has a predefined list of known faces in faceListWithId.json. It is generated by running 

```js
node createfacelist.js 
```

from the command line. You can create your own list by modifying the sampleFaces.json file and run the command above.
